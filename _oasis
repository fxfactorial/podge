Description:
  If you're doing any modern OCaml then you're doubtlessly annoyed
  by the state of libraries and committing to one of the big ones
  can be restricting. Podge is a single module containing specialized
  modules for their respectives usages for seemingly common tasks.
  Podge is especially useful for Hackathons when you want to do a simple
  HTTP get request or want to manipulate JSON.
