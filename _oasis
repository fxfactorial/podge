Description:
  If you're doing any modern OCaml then you're doubtlessly annoyed
  by the state of libraries and committing to one of the big ones
  can be restricting. Podge is a single module containing specialized
  modules for their respectives usages for seemingly common tasks.
  Some conveniences with Podge:
  1) Web: Simple HTTP get/put requests that return Yojson objects
  2) Yojson: Pretty printing, updating keys, and removing key-value pairs
     from Yojson objects
  3) Unix: Read output of a process, simple daemonize.
  4) Xml: Simple reading of node content given a path.
  5) ANSITerminal: Create a colored string for the shell,
     with or without current time.
  6) Other modules: Math, Html5, Analyze, Cohttp, Printf, Debugging,
     and List.
  Podge is especially useful for Hackathons and prototyping.
