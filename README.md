**Podge** is a centralization of helper functions and shortcuts that 
I have frequently found myself writing over and over again in
[OCaml](http://www.ocaml.org). It doesn't depend on Jane Street's [Core](https://github.com/janestreet/core) library, nor does it
depend on [Batteries](https://github.com/ocaml-batteries-team/batteries-included). Rather Podge picks among various existing smaller
packages and provides helper functions for common tasks related to
usages of those libraries. Podge also provides some extra modules,
like the Math module. 

# Yet another Standard Library Replacement?

No, this isn't yet another attempt at a standard library
replacement. Rather this is one place for me to put all code that I've
had scattered all around my hard-drive. Perhaps there will be
something of use in here as well for you. (I hope that some things
here will help newcomers to the language as well)
